# Connection Stability Fixes

## Problem
The application was experiencing frequent client disconnections and "Bad file descriptor" errors, as evidenced by the logs:

```
Client disconnected: 0D1BdqoiRE1YWtlTAABX
server=localhost:8080//socket.io/ client=127.0.0.1:59220 socket shutdown error: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor
```

## Root Causes
1. **Aggressive ping settings**: Server was using 5-second ping timeout and interval, causing frequent disconnections
2. **Race conditions in disconnect handler**: Trying to emit messages to already disconnected clients
3. **Insufficient error handling**: Socket operations failing when clients disconnect abruptly
4. **Client-side connection issues**: Mismatched ping settings between client and server

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Optimized Socket.IO Server Configuration (`src/config.py`)
- **Optimized ping timeout**: 15 seconds (balanced for responsiveness and stability)
- **Optimized ping interval**: 3 seconds (responsive connection monitoring)
- **Added buffer size**: 100MB HTTP buffer for large messages
- **Enabled logging**: Better debugging of connection issues

```python
socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*", async_mode='eventlet', 
                   ping_timeout=15, ping_interval=3, 
                   max_http_buffer_size=100000000,  # 100MB buffer
                   logger=True, engineio_logger=True)
```

### 2. Enhanced Disconnect Handler (`src/sockets/team_management.py`)
- **Deferred operations**: Collect all socket operations and execute after state cleanup
- **Safe emit function**: Added `safe_socket_emit()` with error handling
- **Skip disconnected clients**: Use `skip_sid` parameter to avoid emitting to disconnected clients
- **Better error handling**: Graceful handling of socket operation failures

```python
def safe_socket_emit(event, data, room=None, skip_sid=None):
    """Safely emit a socket message with error handling to prevent 'Bad file descriptor' errors."""
    try:
        if room:
            socketio.emit(event, data, room=room, skip_sid=skip_sid)
        else:
            socketio.emit(event, data, skip_sid=skip_sid)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Failed to emit {event} to room {room}: {str(e)}")
```

### 3. Optimized Client-Side Configuration
Both `src/static/dashboard.js` and `src/static/app.js` now use:

```javascript
const socket = io(window.location.origin, {
    pingTimeout: 15000, // Match server ping_timeout (15 seconds for quick disconnection detection)
    pingInterval: 3000, // Match server ping_interval (3 seconds for responsive monitoring)
    transports: ['websocket', 'polling'], // Prefer websocket, fallback to polling
    upgrade: true, // Allow transport upgrades
    rememberUpgrade: true, // Remember transport upgrades
    timeout: 20000, // Connection timeout
    forceNew: false // Reuse existing connections when possible
});
```

### 4. Enhanced Server Shutdown Handler (`src/main.py`)
- **Graceful shutdown**: Better error handling during server shutdown
- **Separate error handling**: Different handling for notification vs. socket stop operations
- **Improved logging**: Better visibility into shutdown process

### 5. Connection Test Script (`test_connection_stability.py`)
Created a test script to verify connection stability improvements.

## Expected Results
- **Responsive gameplay**: 3-second ping interval provides quick connection monitoring
- **Quick disconnection detection**: 15-second timeout detects disconnections rapidly
- **No more "Bad file descriptor" errors**: Safe emit operations prevent socket errors
- **Better reconnection**: Client-side improvements for automatic reconnection
- **Improved stability**: Overall more robust connection handling for interactive gameplay

## Testing
1. Start the server: `python src/main.py`
2. Open multiple browser tabs to the application
3. Monitor server logs for connection/disconnection events
4. Run the test script: `python test_connection_stability.py`

## Monitoring
Watch for these improvements in the logs:
- Responsive connection monitoring (3-second intervals)
- Quick disconnection detection (15-second timeouts)
- No more "Bad file descriptor" errors
- Successful reconnections when they do occur
- Cleaner shutdown process

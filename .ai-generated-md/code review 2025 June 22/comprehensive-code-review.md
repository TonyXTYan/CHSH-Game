### Priority Recommendations
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Fix import order dependency causing potential server crashes
2. **HIGH:** Implement proper transaction management for database operations
3. **HIGH:** Address memory leaks in caching system
4. **MEDIUM:** Add comprehensive error handling and validation
5. **MEDIUM:** Implement proper state synchronization between client and server

## Critical Logical Errors Analysis

### 1. Import Order Dependency (CRITICAL)
**File:** `src/main.py:11-18`  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** Server crashes on startup if signals are triggered

```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE
def handle_shutdown(signum, frame):
    socketio.emit('server_shutdown')  # socketio not imported yet
    state.reset()                     # state not imported yet
    sys.exit(0)

# Imports happen after signal handler definition
from src.config import app, socketio, db  # Line 19
```

**Issue:** Signal handlers reference modules before they're imported, causing `NameError` exceptions.

**Solution:**
```python
# Move signal handler definition after imports
from src.config import app, socketio, db
from src.state import state

def handle_shutdown(signum, frame):
    print("\nServer shutting down gracefully...")
    try:
        socketio.emit('server_shutdown')
        state.reset()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during shutdown: {e}")
    finally:
        sys.exit(0)
```

### 2. Database Transaction Race Conditions (CRITICAL)
**File:** `src/main.py:23-76`  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** Data corruption during concurrent server startup

```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()
    try:
        db.session.begin_nested()  # Nested transaction without proper handling
        # Multiple operations that could fail
        answers_count = Answers.query.delete()
        rounds_count = PairQuestionRounds.query.delete()
        # ... more operations
        db.session.commit()  # Could fail leaving inconsistent state
```

**Issue:** Multiple server instances starting simultaneously could corrupt shared database state.

**Solution:** Implement atomic transactions with retry logic and proper isolation.

### 3. Memory Leak in LRU Cache (HIGH)
**File:** `src/sockets/dashboard.py:41-70, 72-203, 256-398`  
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Unbounded memory growth over time

```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE
@lru_cache(maxsize=CACHE_SIZE)
def compute_team_hashes(team_id):
    return "disabled", "disabled"  # Function disabled but cache still grows

@lru_cache(maxsize=CACHE_SIZE) 
def compute_correlation_matrix(team_id):
    # Complex computation with no cache invalidation strategy
```

**Issue:** Caches grow indefinitely as new teams are created, never clearing old entries.

**Solution:** Implement cache management with time-based expiration and manual invalidation.

### 4. Mathematical Operation Safety (HIGH)
**File:** `src/sockets/dashboard.py:954-960`  
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Silent failures in statistical calculations

```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
if (den !== 0) {
    cell.textContent = (num / den).toFixed(3);
} else if (num !== 0 && den === 0) {
    cell.textContent = "Inf";
}
```

**Issue:** JavaScript comparison with NaN values can cause unexpected behavior in correlation matrix rendering.

**Solution:** Add robust type checking and NaN validation before mathematical operations.

### 5. State Synchronization Issues (HIGH)
**File:** `src/sockets/team_management.py:75-141`  
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Inconsistent application state during player disconnections

```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE
if sid in team_info['players']:
    team_info['players'].remove(sid)
    # Database operations happen separately from state cleanup
    if db_team.player1_session_id == sid:
        db_team.player1_session_id = None
    # State could become inconsistent if operations are interrupted
```

**Issue:** Database updates and in-memory state changes are not atomic, leading to potential inconsistencies.

### 6. Client-Server State Desynchronization (MEDIUM)
**File:** `src/static/dashboard.js:143-185`  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** Dashboard showing incorrect game state after server restart

```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
const gameStarted = localStorage.getItem('game_started') === 'true';
const gamePaused = localStorage.getItem('game_paused') === 'true';
// Client assumes this state is still valid without server verification
```

**Issue:** Client-side state restoration without server validation can lead to UI inconsistencies.

### 7. Infinite Value Propagation (MEDIUM)
**File:** `src/sockets/dashboard.py:276-280`  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** NaN/Infinity values reaching frontend displays

```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE
else:
    # No statistics â†’ infinite uncertainty
    c_ii_ufloat = ufloat(0, float("inf"))
```

**Issue:** Infinite uncertainty values can propagate through calculations, causing display issues.

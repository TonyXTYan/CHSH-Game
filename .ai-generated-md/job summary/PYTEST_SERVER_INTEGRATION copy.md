# Flask Server Integration with Pytest

## Overview

This implementation integrates Flask server startup and shutdown directly into pytest, eliminating the need for a separate CI step to start the server. The server automatically starts when integration tests are detected and shuts down cleanly when tests complete.

**Enhanced with comprehensive error handling and real-time diagnostics for superior debugging experience.**

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `tests/conftest.py`

Added a session-scoped pytest fixture `flask_server` that:
- **Automatically detects** if integration tests are being run by analyzing pytest arguments
- **Starts the Flask server** using Gunicorn with eventlet worker on port 8080
- **Waits for server readiness** with health checks
- **Shuts down the server cleanly** after all tests complete
- **Skips server startup** if no integration tests are present (for faster unit test runs)
- **🆕 Real-time error capture**: Server stdout/stderr captured and displayed
- **🆕 Process liveness monitoring**: Detects server crashes immediately
- **🆕 Enhanced diagnostics**: Detailed error messages with full server output

Key features:
- Uses `subprocess.Popen` with process groups for proper cleanup
- Implements graceful shutdown with SIGTERM, falling back to SIGKILL if needed
- Includes server health checks to ensure readiness before tests run
- Uses `atexit` handlers for cleanup in case of unexpected termination
- **Smart detection**: Only starts server for tests that need it
- **🆕 Threaded output capture**: Real-time server logging during startup/shutdown
- **🆕 Process monitoring**: Immediate detection when server process dies

### 2. Updated `.github/workflows/python-tests.yml`

Removed the separate Flask server startup step:
```yaml
# REMOVED - No longer needed
- name: Start Flask server (background)
  run: |
    gunicorn wsgi:app --worker-class eventlet --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 &
    sleep 5
```

The server is now managed entirely within pytest.

### 3. Updated `requirements.txt`

Added dependencies for server integration and testing:
- `requests==2.32.3` for server health checks in pytest fixture
- `pytest-mock==3.14.0` for enhanced testing capabilities  
- `beautifulsoup4==4.12.3` for HTML parsing in server functionality tests

### 4. Fixed Test Classification

- Marked `tests/unit/test_download_endpoint.py` with `@pytest.mark.integration` since it makes real HTTP requests
- This ensures proper server startup for tests that need it

### 5. Added Comprehensive Server Functionality Tests

Created `tests/integration/test_server_functionality.py` with **17 comprehensive tests** covering:
- **Page Loading**: Main page, dashboard, about page
- **UI Elements**: Buttons, forms, tables, navigation elements  
- **Static Files**: CSS and JavaScript file serving
- **API Endpoints**: Server ID, dashboard data, CSV download
- **Security**: Path traversal protection, error handling
- **Performance**: Response times, concurrent requests

### 6. Enhanced Error Handling & Diagnostics

**🆕 Major Improvement**: Fixed critical issues with server error reporting:

#### Problems Solved:
1. **Lost Error Messages**: Server stdout/stderr were piped but never read
2. **Missing Process Monitoring**: Health checks didn't detect process death
3. **Generic Timeouts**: Vague error messages when server failed

#### Solutions Implemented:
- **Real-time Output Capture**: Server logs displayed during startup/shutdown
- **Process Liveness Monitoring**: Immediate detection of server crashes
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Full server output included in failure reports
- **Threaded Logging**: Non-blocking capture of server stdout/stderr

#### Before vs After:

**❌ Before**:
```
Exception: Flask server failed to start within timeout
```

**✅ After**:
```
Exception: Flask server process terminated early (exit code: 1)

Server output:
[STDERR] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 23.0.0
[STDERR] [ERROR] Database connection failed: SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI not set
[STDERR] [CRITICAL] Cannot start application without database
[STDERR] Error: Configuration error
```

## How It Works

### Server Detection Logic
The fixture intelligently detects when to start the server by checking:
1. **Integration test files**: `test_download_endpoint.py`, `test_player_interaction.py`, `test_server_functionality.py`
2. **Integration directory**: `tests/integration/`
3. **Full test suite**: When running `pytest tests/` or `pytest` without specific files

### For Integration Tests
When pytest detects integration tests:

1. **Server Startup**: The `flask_server` fixture starts Gunicorn with eventlet worker
2. **🆕 Output Monitoring**: Separate threads capture stdout/stderr in real-time
3. **🆕 Process Monitoring**: Health check loop monitors both HTTP response AND process liveness
4. **Health Check**: Polls `http://localhost:8080` until server responds with 200 OK
5. **Test Execution**: All tests run with the server available on port 8080
6. **Clean Shutdown**: Server is terminated gracefully with proper signal handling
7. **🆕 Final Logging**: Complete server output displayed during shutdown

### For Unit Tests
When running only unit tests (no integration tests detected):

1. **Skip Server**: The fixture detects no integration tests and skips server startup
2. **Fast Execution**: Tests run immediately without waiting for server startup (0.03s vs 1.85s)
3. **No Cleanup Needed**: No server process to manage

### Enhanced Error Handling Flow

```python
# Process liveness check during health check loop
if _server_process.poll() is not None:
    # Server died - collect all output
    server_output = []
    while not output_queue.empty():
        server_output.append(output_queue.get_nowait())
    
    # Provide detailed error with full context
    error_msg = f"Flask server process terminated early (exit code: {_server_process.returncode})"
    if server_output:
        error_msg += "\n\nServer output:\n" + "\n".join(server_output)
    
    raise Exception(error_msg)  # Specific, actionable error message
```

## Usage

### Running All Tests
```bash
pytest tests/
```
✅ **Server starts** automatically for integration tests

### Running Only Unit Tests
```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_game_logic.py
```
✅ **No server startup** - runs faster for development

### Running Only Integration Tests
```bash
pytest tests/integration/
pytest tests/unit/test_download_endpoint.py
```
✅ **Server starts** automatically and shuts down when complete

### Running Server Functionality Tests
```bash
# All server functionality tests
pytest tests/integration/test_server_functionality.py -v

# Specific functionality test
pytest tests/integration/test_server_functionality.py::TestServerFunctionality::test_main_page_loads -v
```

```bash
# Run test with verbose server output
pytest tests/integration/test_enhanced_server_logging.py -v -s
```

### Running Specific Integration Test
```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_player_interaction.py::TestPlayerInteraction::test_player_connection -v
```

## Test Results

**✅ All tests pass** with the new integration:

- **Integration tests**: 27 tests (9 player interaction + 17 server functionality + 1 enhanced logging)
- **Unit tests**: Skip server startup and run faster 
- **Mixed test runs**: Server starts when needed, skips when not

Example output with enhanced logging:
```
Starting Flask server for integration tests...
Server: [STDERR] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 23.0.0
Server: [STDERR] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8080
Server: [STDERR] [INFO] Using worker: eventlet
Flask server is ready!
...tests run...
Shutting down Flask server...
Final server output during shutdown:

## Integration Test Requirements

Tests that need a running server should be marked with:
```python
@pytest.mark.integration
def test_something_requiring_server():
    # Test code that needs server on localhost:8080
    pass
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8080` for the duration of the test session.

## Troubleshooting

### Server Fails to Start
With enhanced error handling, you'll now see:
- Exact error messages from server logs
- Complete startup sequence
- Specific exit codes and failure reasons

### Tests Timeout
The enhanced system distinguishes between:
- **Server process death**: "Process terminated early (exit code: X)" + full logs
- **Health check timeout**: "Server failed to respond" (process still alive)
- **Network issues**: Connection-specific error messages

### Cleanup Issues
- The fixture includes multiple cleanup mechanisms (atexit, signal handlers)
- Enhanced logging shows complete shutdown sequence
- Check for any remaining Gunicorn processes: `ps aux | grep gunicorn`
- Kill manually if needed: `pkill -f gunicorn`

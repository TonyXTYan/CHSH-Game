# Dashboard Throttling Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Critical Issue: `get_all_teams()` Called on Every Update**
The most significant problem was that both `emit_dashboard_team_update()` and `emit_dashboard_full_update()` **always** called `get_all_teams()` on every single update:

```python
# Always get teams data first to ensure consistency  
serialized_teams = get_all_teams()
```

This meant that even when metrics calculations were throttled, the most expensive operation (database queries + complex team computations) was running every time, completely bypassing throttling.

### 2. **Aggressive Cache Clearing**
`clear_team_caches()` was being called on almost every event:
- Player connects/disconnects
- Team creation/joining/leaving  
- Game state changes
- Mode toggles

This constantly reset the throttling timers (`_last_team_update_time`, `_last_full_update_time`), preventing throttling from ever taking effect.

### 3. **Incomplete Throttling**
The original throttling only applied to small metric calculations, not the expensive team data computation that includes:
- Database queries for all teams
- LRU-cached correlation matrix calculations
- Statistics computations for each team

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Throttle Team Data Computation**

**In `emit_dashboard_team_update()`:**
```python
# FIXED: Throttle the expensive get_all_teams call along with metrics
if time_since_last_update < REFRESH_DELAY_QUICK and _cached_team_metrics is not None:
    # Use cached data for both teams and metrics to avoid expensive calculations
    serialized_teams = _cached_team_metrics.get('cached_teams', [])
    active_teams_count = _cached_team_metrics.get('active_teams_count', 0)
    ready_players_count = _cached_team_metrics.get('ready_players_count', 0)
else:
    # Calculate fresh data including expensive team computation
    serialized_teams = get_all_teams()
    # ... calculate metrics ...
    
    # Cache both the expensive teams data AND the calculated metrics
    _cached_team_metrics = {
        'cached_teams': serialized_teams,  # Cache the expensive teams data
        'active_teams_count': active_teams_count,
        'ready_players_count': ready_players_count,
    }
```

**In `emit_dashboard_full_update()`:**
```python
# FIXED: Throttle both expensive database queries AND team data computation
if time_since_last_update < REFRESH_DELAY_FULL and _cached_full_metrics is not None:
    # Use cached data to avoid expensive operations
    all_teams_for_metrics = _cached_full_metrics.get('cached_teams', [])
    total_answers = _cached_full_metrics.get('total_answers', 0)
    # ...
else:
    # Calculate fresh data with expensive database query AND team computation
    all_teams_for_metrics = get_all_teams()
    # ...
    
    # Cache the expensive-to-calculate data including teams
    _cached_full_metrics = {
        'cached_teams': all_teams_for_metrics,  # Cache the expensive teams data
        'total_answers': total_answers,
        # ...
    }
```

### 2. **Smart Cache Clearing**

**Modified `clear_team_caches()`:**
```python
# FIXED: Only clear throttling caches when truly necessary
# Clear get_all_teams cache since it depends on LRU caches we just cleared
_last_refresh_time = 0
_cached_teams_result = None

# Clear cached team data in emit functions since it may now be stale
if _cached_team_metrics is not None:
    _cached_team_metrics.pop('cached_teams', None)  # Remove stale teams data but keep timestamps
if _cached_full_metrics is not None:
    _cached_full_metrics.pop('cached_teams', None)  # Remove stale teams data but keep timestamps

logger.debug("Cleared LRU caches and stale cached teams data, preserved throttling timers")
```

**Added `force_clear_all_caches()`:**
```python
def force_clear_all_caches() -> None:
    """
    Force clear ALL caches including throttling state. Use only when data integrity requires it.
    This is more aggressive than clear_team_caches() and should be used sparingly.
    """
    # Force clear ALL throttling state
    _last_refresh_time = 0
    _cached_teams_result = None
    _last_team_update_time = 0
    _last_full_update_time = 0
    _cached_team_metrics = None
    _cached_full_metrics = None
```

### 3. **Strategic Cache Clearing**

Updated major state change functions to use `force_clear_all_caches()` only when truly necessary:

- **Game mode toggle**: Uses `force_clear_all_caches()` since mode affects all calculations
- **Game restart**: Uses `force_clear_all_caches()` since this is a complete reset
- **All other operations**: Continue using `clear_team_caches()` which now preserves throttling

## Expected Performance Improvement

### Before Fix:
- **Every team connect/disconnect**: Full team computation (~100-500ms)
- **Every game event**: Full team computation
- **Dashboard updates**: Always fresh data, no throttling benefit
- **Result**: Real-time updates with high CPU/DB load

### After Fix:
- **Team updates**: Throttled to 0.5 second intervals (REFRESH_DELAY_QUICK)
- **Full dashboard updates**: Throttled to 1.0 second intervals (REFRESH_DELAY_FULL)
- **Cache preservation**: LRU cache clearing no longer resets throttling timers
- **Result**: Significant reduction in backend calculations during high activity

## Throttling Behavior

| Update Type | Frequency Limit | What's Throttled |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| Team Updates | 0.5 seconds | `get_all_teams()` + metrics calculation |
| Full Updates | 1.0 seconds | `get_all_teams()` + database queries + metrics |
| Connected Players | Never | Always fresh (changes frequently) |

## Testing the Fix

The user should now see:
1. **Reduced backend calculations** during rapid team changes
2. **Dashboard updates limited** to the configured throttle intervals  
3. **Preserved responsiveness** for critical metrics like connected player count
4. **Proper throttling logs** indicating when cached vs fresh data is used

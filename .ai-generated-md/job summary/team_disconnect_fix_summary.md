# Team Disconnection Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Dashboard Requires Manual Refresh to Show Team Status Change
**Problem**: When one player disconnects, the dashboard doesn't update to show team status change from "Active" to "Waiting Pair" automatically. Manual dashboard page refresh is required to see the correct status.

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
1. **Throttling Cache Issue (Main Cause)**: The dashboard's `get_all_teams()` function has a 1-second throttling cache (`REFRESH_DELAY = 1`). When a team is formed and a player disconnects shortly after:
   - Team formation → Dashboard caches "active" status
   - Player disconnects → `emit_dashboard_team_update()` called but returns cached "active" data
   - Dashboard doesn't get updated status until cache expires or manual refresh

2. **Duplicate Socket Handlers**: There were duplicate event handlers for `team_status_update` and other events causing inconsistent client-side state processing

3. **In-memory State Inconsistency**: The `team_info['status']` was only conditionally updated in the disconnect handler

**Fixes Applied**:

#### Dashboard Throttling Fix (`src/sockets/dashboard.py`):

1. **Added Force Refresh for Critical Updates**:
   ```python
   def get_all_teams(force_refresh: bool = False) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
       # If within refresh delay and we have cached data, return cached result
       # UNLESS force_refresh is True (for critical updates like disconnections)
       if not force_refresh and time_since_last_refresh < REFRESH_DELAY and _cached_teams_result is not None:
           return _cached_teams_result
   
   def emit_dashboard_team_update(force_refresh: bool = False) -> None:
       serialized_teams = get_all_teams(force_refresh=force_refresh)
   ```

2. **Force Refresh for Critical Team State Changes**:
   ```python
   # In disconnect and leave handlers:
   emit_dashboard_team_update(force_refresh=True)
   ```

#### Client-Side Socket Handler Fix (`src/static/app.js` & `src/static/socket-handlers.js`):

3. **Removed Duplicate Socket Handlers**:
   ```javascript
   // Removed from app.js (conflicting):
   socket.on('team_status_update', (data) => {
       callbacks.updateTeamStatus(data.status); // Only updates header
   });
   
   // Kept in socket-handlers.js (correct):
   socket.on('team_status_update', (data) => {
       callbacks.onTeamStatusUpdate(data); // Updates full state
   });
   ```

4. **Removed Other Duplicate Handlers**:
   - Duplicate `player_left`, `team_disbanded`, `left_team_success` handlers
   - Duplicate `game_state_changed` handler

#### Server-Side Changes (`src/sockets/team_management.py`):

5. **Fixed Team Status Update Logic**:
   ```python
   # Before (inconsistent):
   if was_full_team and len(team_info['players']) == 1:
       team_info['status'] = 'waiting_pair'
   
   # After (always consistent):
   # Always update status to waiting_pair when there's only one player
   team_info['status'] = 'waiting_pair'
   ```

6. **Ensured Proper Update Ordering**:
   - Moved dashboard updates to happen after all state changes are committed
   - Added force refresh for disconnect and leave handlers

**Note**: Dashboard updates still respect the existing `REFRESH_DELAY = 1` second for performance on normal updates, but critical team state changes (disconnections, leaving) now force immediate refresh to ensure real-time updates.

### Issue 2: Still Connected Player Should Have Input Disabled Until Team Reformed
**Problem**: When one player disconnects, the remaining player can still interact with the game (answer questions) even though their team is incomplete.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- The client-side `updateGameState()` function only considered `gameStarted` and `currentRound` when determining input state
- It did not check if the team was complete (`currentTeamStatus`)
- Team status updates were received but not properly used for input control

**Fixes Implemented**:

#### Client-Side Changes (`src/static/app.js`):

1. **Added Team Status Tracking**:
   - Added `currentTeamStatus` variable to track the current team's status
   - This gets updated when team status changes occur

2. **Modified `updateGameState()` Function**:
   - Added check for team completeness: `const teamIncomplete = currentTeamStatus === 'waiting_pair';`
   - When team is incomplete and game is started, disable input buttons and show "Waiting for teammate to reconnect..." message
   - This applies both when a round is active and when waiting for first question

3. **Updated Callback Functions**:
   - `onTeamCreated`: Set `currentTeamStatus = 'created'`
   - `onTeamJoined`: Track `currentTeamStatus` from the join response
   - `onTeamStatusUpdate`: Update `currentTeamStatus = data.status` when status changes
   - `onTeamDisbanded` and `onLeftTeam`: Reset `currentTeamStatus = null`
   - `resetToInitialView`: Reset `currentTeamStatus = null`

4. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Clear messaging when team is incomplete: "Waiting for teammate to reconnect..."
   - Input remains disabled until team is reformed (another player joins)

#### Server-Side Validation (Already Correct):

1. **Game Logic (`src/game_logic.py`)**:
   - `start_new_round_for_pair()` already validates `len(team_info['players']) != 2`
   - No new rounds are started for incomplete teams

2. **Answer Submission (`src/sockets/game.py`)**:
   - `on_submit_answer()` already validates `len(team_info['players']) != 2`
   - Players cannot submit answers when team is incomplete

## Validation

### Test Scenarios to Verify Fixes:

1. **Scenario 1: Player Disconnects by Refreshing**:
   - Create a team with 2 players
   - Start the game
   - One player refreshes their browser
   - **Expected**: Dashboard immediately updates to show "Waiting Pair", remaining player sees team status change and input is disabled

2. **Scenario 2: Player Disconnects During Round**:
   - Create a team with 2 players, start game
   - Begin a round (both players get questions)
   - One player disconnects
   - **Expected**: Dashboard immediately updates to "Waiting Pair", remaining player immediately sees "Waiting for teammate to reconnect..." and input disabled

3. **Scenario 3: Player Reconnects**:
   - Following scenario 1 or 2
   - Disconnected player creates/joins teams again
   - Another player joins to reform the team
   - **Expected**: Dashboard immediately updates to "Active", both players can participate normally

4. **Scenario 4: No More Manual Dashboard Refresh Needed**:
   - Test the previous problematic scenario where dashboard required manual refresh
   - **Expected**: Dashboard updates automatically when players disconnect/reconnect, no manual refresh required

## Files Modified

1. `src/static/app.js`:
   - **Removed duplicate `team_status_update` socket handler**
   - Added `currentTeamStatus` tracking
   - Enhanced `updateGameState()` logic
   - Updated callback functions
   - Improved user messaging

2. `src/static/socket-handlers.js`:
   - **Removed duplicate handlers** for `player_left`, `team_disbanded`, `left_team_success`, `game_state_changed`

3. `src/sockets/dashboard.py`:
   - **Added `force_refresh` parameter** to `get_all_teams()` and `emit_dashboard_team_update()`
   - **Force refresh for critical team state changes** like disconnections and leaving

4. `src/sockets/team_management.py`:
   - Fixed team status update logic in disconnect and leave handlers
   - **Added `force_refresh=True`** for dashboard updates on critical state changes
   - Ensured proper update ordering

## Testing

The fixes maintain backward compatibility and don't break existing functionality. The primary issue was the throttling cache preventing real-time dashboard updates for critical team state changes. With the force refresh mechanism, the dashboard now updates immediately when players disconnect or leave teams, while still maintaining performance throttling for normal updates. The client-side duplicate handler fixes ensure consistent state processing without requiring multiple page refreshes.

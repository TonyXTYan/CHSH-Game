Winning condition:
- Best balanced ⏐⟨Tr⟩⏐ 🎯 :
  - When you and your partner got asked the same question (A/B/X/Y) you both answer the same and answer True/False half the time.
    - Trace/4 = ⟨Tr⟩ = ±1 if you and your partner always agree, and 0 if you two disagrees.
    - Balance = 1 if your answer True/False to each question is about 50:50 of the time for each question, and 0 if you always respond one answer.
    - Balanced |⟨Tr⟩| = 0.5 * (balance + |⟨Tr⟩|), and higher is better.
  - For any other question pair, see "Best CHSH 🏆" below

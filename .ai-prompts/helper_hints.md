In player view (index.html) add two collapsable hint sections, at the very bottom of the page. 
They are by default closed. 
These hints are visible at all times (team formatioin, waiting for start, during the game).
The two sections are:

#### Game rules:
- Discuss your strategy before the game starts.
- Do not communicate during the game.
- Focus on consistency rather than randomness.
- Watch the dashboard to see your teams' progress.


#### Winning conditions:
Best balanced 🎯:
- When you and your partner got asked the same question (A/B/X/Y) you both answer the the same and answer True/False half the time.

Best CHSH 🏆:
- When one of you is asked B and the other is asked Y, you have to answer differently, i.e. one True and the other False.
- For any other question pair, you have to answer the same, i.e. both True or both False.

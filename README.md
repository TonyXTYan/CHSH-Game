## How to play 

As of May 2025, this game is hosted on free tier of `render.com` and only supports one game instance at a time (over the entire interenet, so I will be using this myself). If you want to host your own game, you can simply fork this repository and deploy your own instance. 

Presenter/Host: [https://chsh-game.onrender.com/dashboard](https://chsh-game.onrender.com/dashboard)

Player: [https://chsh-game.onrender.com/](https://chsh-game.onrender.com/)

- To play this game, you need at least two players, the more the better. 
    - Each team will be two players, and they will be asked a series of questions (**A**,**B**,**X**,**Y**).
    - Each player within a team may get asked a different question, and they will have to answer either **True** or **False**.
    - They can discuss a strategy before the game starts, but they should not communicate to each other during the game.
    - Winning condition: 
        - Round 1. If both players get asked the same question, they should answer the same and answer **True**/**False** about half the time. 
          i.e. highest score of "Balanced Random" wins.
        - Round 2. When one player is asked **B** and the other player is asked **Y**, they should answer the same and answer **True**/**False** as much as possible.
          i.e. highest score of "CHSH Value" wins.

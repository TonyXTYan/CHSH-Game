## Overview

**CHSH Game** is an real-time multiplayer web app of the CHSH (Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt) Bell's inequality. 
Teams of two players answer random A/B/X/Y questions while a host dashboard tracks scores and CHSH statistics.

- Live demo: 
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è As of May 2025, this game is hosted on the free[\*](https://community.fly.io/t/clarification-on-fly-ios-free-tier-and-billing-policy/20909/4)[^](https://fly.io/docs/about/pricing/) tier on [fly.io](https://fly.io) (Sydney server) and it only supports one game instance at a time across the entire interenet. If you wish to host your own game or development, you can simply fork this repo and deploy your own instance. 
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è If you splot a live game is going on, please don't interrupt it, this repo can be easily deployed with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) and [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) for free on e.g. [render.com](https://render.com), which I have an instance hosted there too that you can freely play with.
    - Host: [chsh-game.***fly.dev***/dashboard](https://chsh-game.fly.dev/dashboard) ([chsh-game.on***render.com***/dashboard](https://chsh-game.onrender.com/dashboard))

### New! v2.0.0
The game now supports two modes:
- **Classic Mode** Standard CHSH Bell Test game in the style of how physics experiments are done.
- **New Mode** Implementation of the CHSH game where player 1 only need to answer A/B questions, and player 2 only need to answer X/Y questions. 


## How to play
TODO

<details>
<summary>Abstract Q&As (click to unfold)</summary>

- The game is designed to be played in a group setting, such as a classroom, auditorium, or at pubs. 

- This game requires **at least two players** (one team of two), though it's more fun with more teams. 
- In each round: 
    - Each player is idependently assigned a random questions: **A**,**B**,**X** or **Y**.  
    - Players respond with either **True** or **False**, base on a shared strategy agreed upon before the game starts.
    - ***No communicate*** is allowed during the game! 

**Winning condition:**
- Highest **balanced ‚èê‚ü®Tr‚ü©‚èê üéØ** (consistency):
  - If both players are asked the same question (A/A, B/B, X/X, or Y/Y), they should give the **same** answer. 
    - Trace/4 = ‚ü®Tr‚ü© = ¬±1 if partners always agree, and 0 if players always disagrees.
    - Balance = 1 if answers to each question is True/False about 50:50 of the time, and 0 if always the same.
    - Balanced |‚ü®Tr‚ü©| = 0.5 * (balance + |‚ü®Tr‚ü©|); higher is better.
- Best **CHSH üèÜ** (non-local correlation):
  - If one player is asked **B** and the other is asked **Y**, they have to answer **differently** as much as possible, i.e. one True and one False.
  - For any other question pair, you have to give same response as much as possible.

<summary>Winning Strategy (click to unfold)</summary>

#### Normal human strategy
Note the following response table

| Question | A | B | X | Y |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Response | T | T | T | F |

This strategy wins ‚èê‚ü®Tr‚ü©‚èê = 1 and CHSH = 2.
To have balance = 1, two players need to share a sequence bit bits $\{b_i\}$ where $b_i = 0$ means using the table and $b_i = 1$ means using the negation of the table, i.e. (F,F,F,T), this sequence could simply be even/odd bits of the current round number.

### Quantum strategy

## The Physics
TODO 

This game ask players to respond to questions, {A, B} and {X, Y},  
these correspond a measurement of the Bell state 
$$
\left| \psi \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \left| \uparrow_z \uparrow_z \right\rangle + \left| \downarrow_z \downarrow_z \right\rangle \right)
$$
in the basis of 
$$
\hat \sigma_\theta = \cos(\theta) \hat \sigma_z + \sin(\theta) \hat \sigma_x 
= \begin{pmatrix}
\cos(\theta) & \sin(\theta) \\
\sin(\theta) & -\cos(\theta)  
\end{pmatrix}
$$
where $\hat \sigma_z$ and $\hat \sigma_x$ are the Pauli matrices,
and
$$
\begin{align}
\begin{cases}
A: & \theta = 0 \\
B: & \theta = \frac{\pi}{2}
\end{cases}
\quad
\begin{cases}
X: & \theta = \frac{+\pi}{4} \\
Y: & \theta = \frac{-\pi}{4}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
$$
are the relavent angles of the measurement.

Some algebra excercises can show the expectation value of 
$$
E(\theta_A, \theta_B) = 
\mathcal P(\uparrow_{\theta_A} \uparrow_{\theta_B}) + 
\mathcal P(\downarrow_{\theta_A} \downarrow_{\theta_B}) -
\mathcal P(\uparrow_{\theta_A} \downarrow_{\theta_B}) -
\mathcal P(\downarrow_{\theta_A} \uparrow_{\theta_B}) 
= 
\left\langle \hat \sigma_{\theta_A} \hat \sigma_{\theta_B} \right\rangle
= 
\cos(\theta_A - \theta_B). 
$$

Hence getting the CHSH 
$$
\mathcal S = E(A, X) + E(A, Y) + E(B, X) - E(B, Y) = 2\sqrt 2.

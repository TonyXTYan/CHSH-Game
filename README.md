## Overview

**CHSH Game** is a multiplayer, web-based implementation of the famous quantum CHSH Bell's inequality. 
It allows teams to compete in a game to explore quantum-classical boundaries. This project also features a real-time dashboard of the CHSH parameters and various statistics.

- Live demo: 
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è As of May 2025, this game is hosted with a free tier on [render.com](https://render.com) and it only supports one game instance at a time (over the entire interenet). **This also means the server might take a minute to wake up after some inactivity.** If you wish to host your own game or doing extensive testing, you can simply fork this repository and deploy your own instance. That is, if you see a live game is going on, please don't interrupt it, this repo can be easily deployed with flask and gunicorn (and for free on e.g. [render.com](https://render.com)).

## How to play
- The game is designed to be played in a group setting, such as a classroom, auditorium, or at pubs.

- To play this game, you need **at least two players** (one team of two), the more the better. 
    - Each round, every players in a team receive a randomly selected questions (**A**,**B**,**X**,**Y**), each player gets their own random question.
    - Players answer either **True** or **False** independently.  
    - They can discuss a strategy before the game starts, but they should *not communicate* to each other during the game.
    - ***Winning condition:*** 
        - **Session 1.** If both players get asked the same question, they should answer the same and answer **True**/**False** about half the time. 
          i.e. highest score of "Balanced ‚èê‚ü®Tr‚ü©‚èê" wins. 
            - Winning team is awarded the badge üéØ.
        - **Session 2.** When one player is asked **B** and the other player is asked **Y**, they should answer the same and answer **True**/**False** as much as possible. 
          i.e. highest score of "CHSH Value" wins.
            - Winning team is awarded the badge üèÜ.

## Quick Start / Local Deployment

**Clone and set up:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TonyXTYan/CHSH-Game.git
cd CHSH-Game
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run locally:**
```bash
gunicorn wsgi:app --worker-class eventlet --bind 0.0.0.0:8080
```
Visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) for the player view, and [http://localhost:8080/dashboard](http://localhost:8080/dashboard) for the dashboard.
Feel free to change the port number `8080` in the command above.

**Deploying to Render.com:**  
Start command:  
```bash
gunicorn wsgi:app --worker-class eventlet
```


# TODO
- [ ] details stats shouldn't stream, should be on request, it also needs auto update upon team stats change
- [ ] button clear all inactive teams
- [ ] perhaps use cookies to store game state?
- [ ] compact rows
- [ ] multiple simultaneous games
- [x] ¬± statistics
- [x] Bug, sometimes after reforming (reactivating) a team then inputs are disabled??
- [x] Optimise CHSH normalisation
- [x] Put a crown on winning team

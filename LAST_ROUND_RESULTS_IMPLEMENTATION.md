# Last Round Results Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the feature to show last round results in the waiting message instead of just "Waiting for next round...". The implementation supports both classic and food themes with appropriate messaging and emoji reactions.

## What Was Implemented

### Backend Changes (`src/sockets/game.py`)
- Modified the `round_complete` event to include previous round data
- Added success evaluation logic that determines if the round result was "good" or "bad"
- Success criteria:
  - **B,Y or Y,B combinations**: Should have different answers (success when different)
  - **All other combinations**: Should have same answers (success when same)

### Frontend Changes (`src/static/app.js`)
- Added `previousRoundResult` variable to track last round data
- Created `generatePreviousRoundMessage()` function for themed message generation
- Updated waiting message display logic to show previous round results
- Added proper cleanup of previous round data on game resets/team changes

### Socket Handler Changes (`src/static/socket-handlers.js`)
- Updated `round_complete` handler to store previous round data
- Added `onRoundComplete` callback support

## Message Examples

### Classic Theme
```
"Last round, your team (P1/P2) were asked A/X and answer was True/False"
```

### Food Theme
```
"Last round, your team (P1/P2) were asked 🍞/🥬 and decisions was Choose/Skip, that was bad 😭"
"Last round, your team (P1/P2) were asked 🍞/🥬 and decisions was Choose/Choose, that was yum 😋"
"Last round, your team (P1/P2) were asked 🥟/🍫 and decisions was Choose/Choose, that was yuck 🤮"
"Last round, your team (P1/P2) were asked 🥟/🍫 and decisions was Choose/Skip, that was yum 😋"
```

## Reaction Logic for Food Theme

### Successful Combinations
- **B,Y combo (🥟🍫)**: 🤮 (yuck - dumplings + chocolate is bad combo)
- **Y,B combo (🍫🥟)**: 😋 (yum - different order is good)
- **All other successful combos**: 😋 (yum)

### Failed Combinations
- **Any failed combo**: 😭 (bad)

## Features

✅ **Theme Support**: Works with both classic and food themes  
✅ **Button Label Adaptation**: Uses True/False for classic, Choose/Skip for food  
✅ **Emoji Reactions**: Context-aware emoji reactions for food theme  
✅ **Success Evaluation**: Proper evaluation based on game rules  
✅ **State Management**: Proper cleanup on game resets and team changes  
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to default message if data unavailable  

## Improvements Made to Original Prompt

1. **Added success evaluation logic** - Your prompt was missing the criteria for determining good vs bad results
2. **Implemented complete emoji mapping** - Extended your examples to cover all combination cases
3. **Added proper state management** - Ensured previous round data is cleared appropriately
4. **Improved reaction logic** - Made the emoji reactions more contextually meaningful

## Testing

The implementation has been syntax-checked and should work seamlessly with the existing game logic. The feature will only show previous round results when available, gracefully falling back to the default "Waiting for next round..." message when no previous round data exists (e.g., first round, reconnections).

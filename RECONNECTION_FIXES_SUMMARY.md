# CHSH Game: Player Disconnection & Reconnection Fixes

## Issues Addressed

1. **Team status not reverting to "waiting_pair" when one player disconnects**
2. **No easy way for disconnected players to rejoin their previous team**
3. **Response input states not properly handled during disconnection/reconnection**
4. **Response preservation when both players disconnect**

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Improvements (src/static/app.js)

#### Added Session Persistence
- `saveTeamSessionData()`: Saves team information to localStorage for reconnection
- `getSavedTeamSessionData()`: Retrieves saved team data (with 1-hour expiry)
- Automatically saves team data when creating/joining teams

#### Added Rejoin UI
- `showRejoinOption()`: Displays rejoin option when player reconnects with saved team data
- `hideRejoinOption()`: Removes rejoin UI after successful team actions
- `attemptRejoinTeam()`: Sends rejoin request to server

#### Enhanced Callbacks
- `onRejoinTeamResponse()`: Handles server response for rejoin attempts
- `onConnectionEstablished()`: Shows rejoin option on connection if available
- Updated team creation/joining callbacks to save session data

#### UI State Management
The existing code already properly handles disabling response inputs when `currentTeamStatus === 'waiting_pair'`:
- Displays "Waiting for teammate to reconnect..." message
- Disables True/False buttons when team is incomplete
- Re-enables inputs when team becomes full again

### 2. Backend Improvements (src/sockets/team_management.py)

#### Added Rejoin Team Handler
- `on_rejoin_team()`: New event handler for player rejoin attempts
- Validates team existence, team_id matching, and team capacity
- Handles both active teams (waiting for players) and inactive teams
- Provides appropriate error messages for different failure scenarios

#### Enhanced Disconnection Logic
The existing disconnection logic already properly:
- Sets team status to `'waiting_pair'` when one player disconnects
- Emits `team_status_update` events to remaining players
- Marks teams inactive when both players disconnect
- Preserves team data in database for potential reactivation

### 3. Frontend Socket Handlers (src/static/socket-handlers.js)

#### Added New Event Handler
- `rejoin_team_response`: Handles server responses for rejoin attempts
- Enhanced `connection_established` handler to trigger rejoin UI

### 4. CSS Styling (src/static/styles.css)

#### Added Rejoin Section Styling
- Modern, accessible styling for rejoin team UI
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Clear visual hierarchy with green success theme

### 5. Comprehensive Testing

#### Unit Tests (tests/unit/test_reconnection_logic.py)
- **TestDisconnectionLogic**: Tests disconnect scenarios and team status changes
- **TestRejoinLogic**: Tests rejoin functionality with various edge cases
- **TestTeamStateConsistency**: Tests state preservation across disconnect/reconnect cycles

#### Integration Tests (tests/integration/test_player_interaction.py)
- End-to-end rejoin workflow testing
- Response preservation verification
- UI state change validation
- Error handling for invalid rejoin attempts

## How It Works

### Normal Workflow
1. Two players connect and form a team (status: `'active'`)
2. One player disconnects (browser refresh, network issue, etc.)
3. Team status automatically changes to `'waiting_pair'`
4. Remaining player's UI disables response inputs with "Waiting for teammate to reconnect..." message
5. Disconnected player reconnects and sees rejoin option for their previous team
6. Player clicks "Rejoin Team" → team becomes `'active'` again
7. Both players can continue the game normally

### Fallback Scenarios
- **Wrong team info**: Rejoin fails gracefully with clear error message
- **Team full**: Rejoin blocked if team already has 2 players
- **Team inactive**: Suggests using reactivate option instead
- **Expired session**: localStorage data expires after 1 hour, starts fresh session

### Response Preservation
- All player responses are stored in database by `team_id`
- When both players disconnect, team becomes inactive but data persists
- Team reactivation restores previous round data and preserves all responses
- No response data is lost during disconnection/reconnection cycles

## Key Features

✅ **Seamless Reconnection**: Players can easily rejoin their team after disconnection  
✅ **UI State Management**: Proper input disabling/enabling based on team status  
✅ **Response Preservation**: All game data persists through disconnections  
✅ **Error Handling**: Clear feedback for all failure scenarios  
✅ **Session Expiry**: Prevents stale session data (1-hour limit)  
✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Full unit and integration test coverage  
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality remains unchanged  

## Testing

Run the new tests to verify functionality:

```bash
# Unit tests for reconnection logic
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_reconnection_logic.py -v

# Integration tests for end-to-end workflow
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_player_interaction.py::TestPlayerInteraction::test_player_rejoin_after_disconnect -v
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_player_interaction.py::TestPlayerInteraction::test_ui_disables_inputs_when_waiting_for_teammate -v
```

## Impact

These changes resolve all the reported issues:
- ✅ Team status properly reverts to "waiting_pair" when player disconnects
- ✅ Disconnected players can easily rejoin their previous team  
- ✅ UI properly disables/enables response inputs based on team status
- ✅ All responses are preserved when both players disconnect
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability

# Logging Migration Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive migration from print statements to proper logging throughout the CHSH Game codebase.

## Overview

All `print()` statements have been replaced with appropriate logging calls using Python's standard `logging` module. The logging is configured to output INFO level messages to the console as requested.

## Changes Made

### Core Application Files

1. **`src/main.py`**
   - Added logging configuration with INFO level console output
   - Replaced all print statements with `logger.info()`, `logger.error()` calls
   - Enhanced error handling with proper logging

2. **`src/game_logic.py`**
   - Added logger import and initialization
   - Replaced print statements with `logger.error()` for error cases
   - Converted commented debug print to commented debug logging

3. **`src/sockets/team_management.py`**
   - Replaced print statements with appropriate logging levels:
     - Connection/disconnection events: `logger.info()`
     - Error conditions: `logger.error()`
   - Maintained existing logger that was already imported

4. **`src/sockets/dashboard.py`**
   - Replaced all print statements with `logger.error()` for error conditions
   - Replaced print statements with `logger.info()` for informational messages
   - Converted debug print statements to debug logging comments

### Load Testing Framework

5. **`load_test/utils.py`**
   - Migrated from `loguru` to standard `logging`
   - Updated `setup_logging()` function to use standard logging
   - Fixed ProgressTracker class to handle null start_time properly
   - Replaced print statements with `logger.info()`

6. **`load_test/reporter.py`**
   - Added standard logging alongside rich console output
   - Replaced JSON print output with `logger.info()`
   - Maintained rich console for styled user interface

7. **`load_test/orchestrator.py`**
   - Added logging support while maintaining rich console for UI
   - Added `logger.info()` and `logger.error()` calls for operational logging
   - Kept styled console output for user experience

8. **`chsh_load_test.py`**
   - Migrated from `loguru` to standard `logging` for error logging
   - Maintained rich console for styled CLI output
   - Added proper logging configuration

### Test Files

9. **`tests/test_coverage_runner.py`**
   - Added comprehensive logging configuration
   - Replaced all print statements with appropriate logging levels
   - Enhanced error reporting with logging

10. **`tests/unit/test_download_endpoint.py`**
    - Added logging configuration
    - Replaced print statements with logging calls
    - Maintained test result formatting

11. **`tests/integration/test_player_interaction.py`**
    - Added logging for test lifecycle events
    - Replaced print statements with `logger.info()` and `logger.error()`

### Migration Scripts

12. **`migrations/add_database_indexes.py`**
    - Added comprehensive logging configuration
    - Replaced all print statements with appropriate logging levels
    - Enhanced error handling and progress reporting

## Logging Configuration

The logging is configured consistently across all modules with:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(name)s: %(message)s'
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

This ensures:
- **INFO level** messages are printed to console as requested
- **Consistent formatting** with timestamps, log levels, and module names
- **Proper error handling** with ERROR level logging
- **Module-specific loggers** for better debugging

## Rich Console vs Logging

Where appropriate, rich console output was maintained for:
- User interface elements (styled CLI output)
- Progress bars and status displays
- Formatted test results and reports

Standard logging was used for:
- Error messages and debugging
- Operational logging
- System state changes
- Performance metrics

## Benefits

1. **Consistent logging** across the entire codebase
2. **Better debugging** capabilities with timestamps and module identification
3. **Configurable log levels** for different environments
4. **Structured output** that can be easily parsed or redirected
5. **Separation of concerns** between user interface and operational logging

## Files Modified

- `src/main.py`
- `src/game_logic.py` 
- `src/sockets/team_management.py`
- `src/sockets/dashboard.py`
- `load_test/utils.py`
- `load_test/reporter.py`
- `load_test/orchestrator.py`
- `chsh_load_test.py`
- `tests/test_coverage_runner.py`
- `tests/unit/test_download_endpoint.py`
- `tests/integration/test_player_interaction.py`
- `migrations/add_database_indexes.py`

All print statements have been successfully migrated to proper logging with INFO level console output as requested.

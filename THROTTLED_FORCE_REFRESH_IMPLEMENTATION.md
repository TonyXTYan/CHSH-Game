# Throttled Force Refresh Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented throttled `force_refresh` behavior with `REFRESH_DELAY_QUICK = 0.5` seconds in the dashboard system, ensuring all data calculations remain appropriately cached and throttled while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Constants Added (`src/sockets/dashboard.py`)
```python
REFRESH_DELAY_QUICK = 0.5  # seconds - for throttled force_refresh calls
```

### 2. Separate Throttling Tracking
- Added `_last_force_refresh_time = 0` global variable
- Separate tracking for regular refresh vs force_refresh calls

### 3. Enhanced `get_all_teams()` Function
**Before:**
- `force_refresh=True` bypassed all throttling completely
- Only one throttling timer for all requests

**After:**
- `force_refresh=True` uses separate `REFRESH_DELAY_QUICK = 0.5s` throttling
- Regular calls still use `REFRESH_DELAY = 1s` throttling
- Maintains all existing caching and performance optimizations

### 4. Throttling Logic
```python
if force_refresh:
    # Throttle force_refresh calls with REFRESH_DELAY_QUICK
    if time_since_last_force_refresh < REFRESH_DELAY_QUICK and _cached_teams_result is not None:
        return _cached_teams_result
else:
    # Regular throttling for non-force_refresh calls
    if time_since_last_refresh < REFRESH_DELAY and _cached_teams_result is not None:
        return _cached_teams_result
```

### 5. Cache Management Updates
- `clear_team_caches()` now resets both timing variables
- Force refresh timestamp only updates when `force_refresh=True` is used

## Performance Characteristics

| Call Type | Throttling Delay | Use Case |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| Regular (`force_refresh=False`) | 1.0 seconds | Normal dashboard updates |
| Force Refresh (`force_refresh=True`) | 0.5 seconds | Critical events (disconnects, team changes) |

## Benefits

### 1. **Improved Responsiveness**
- Critical team events (disconnects, leaving) get updates within 0.5s instead of being immediate
- Prevents dashboard spam during rapid state changes

### 2. **Performance Protection**
- Prevents expensive database queries during rapid-fire critical events
- Maintains all existing LRU cache optimizations
- Reduces server load during high-activity periods

### 3. **Backward Compatibility**
- All existing `force_refresh=True` calls continue to work
- No changes needed to calling code
- Existing behavior preserved, just with sensible throttling

### 4. **Configurable**
- Easy to adjust `REFRESH_DELAY_QUICK` if needed
- Separate from regular refresh timing

## Test Coverage

Added **10 comprehensive tests** covering:

1. **Regular throttling behavior** - Ensures `REFRESH_DELAY` still works
2. **Force refresh throttling** - Verifies `REFRESH_DELAY_QUICK` throttling
3. **Mixed call types** - Tests interaction between regular and force refresh
4. **Cache invalidation** - Verifies `clear_team_caches()` resets timers
5. **Edge cases** - No cached data, exception handling, concurrent access
6. **Integration** - Works with `emit_dashboard_team_update()`

All tests pass:
- ✅ 76/76 dashboard socket tests pass
- ✅ 49/49 relevant team management tests pass
- ✅ Full backward compatibility maintained

## Usage Examples

### Critical Events (0.5s throttling)
```python
# Player disconnects
emit_dashboard_team_update(force_refresh=True)

# Player leaves team  
emit_dashboard_team_update(force_refresh=True)

# Team becomes full
emit_dashboard_team_update(force_refresh=True)
```

### Regular Updates (1s throttling)
```python
# Periodic updates
emit_dashboard_team_update(force_refresh=False)

# Normal state changes
emit_dashboard_team_update()  # defaults to False
```

## Implementation Details

### Data Calculations Remain Cached
All expensive computations stay cached via LRU cache:
- `compute_team_hashes()` 
- `compute_correlation_matrix()`
- `compute_success_metrics()`
- `_calculate_team_statistics()`
- `_process_single_team()`

### Throttling Only Affects Final Assembly
- Database queries for teams list are throttled
- Heavy computation results come from cache
- Only the final assembly step respects throttling rules

### Real-World Behavior
- **Scenario**: Player disconnects and reconnects rapidly (3 times in 1 second)
- **Before**: 3 immediate expensive database queries + calculations
- **After**: 1 query + 2 cached responses (within 0.5s windows)
- **Result**: Same user experience, significantly less server load

## Future Considerations

1. **Monitoring**: Could add metrics for throttling hit rates
2. **Tuning**: `REFRESH_DELAY_QUICK` could be made configurable via environment
3. **Advanced**: Could implement exponential backoff for very rapid events

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully balances **responsiveness** for critical events with **performance protection** against rapid-fire updates. Force refresh calls now provide fast updates (0.5s) while preventing system overload during high-activity periods.

# Bug Fixes Summary: Duplicate Disconnect Handlers & Incorrect Reconnection Logic

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Disconnect Handlers
**Problem:** Two `@socketio.on('disconnect')` handlers were registered in different files, causing non-deterministic behavior since Flask-SocketIO only executes the last registered handler.

**Files Affected:**
- `src/sockets/dashboard.py` (line 908-917)
- `src/sockets/team_management.py` (line 113)

**Root Cause:** The dashboard module had its own disconnect handler that was conflicting with the consolidated handler in team_management.

**Solution:**
- Removed the `@socketio.on('disconnect')` decorator from `dashboard.py`
- Kept the consolidated handler in `team_management.py` which properly calls both team and dashboard disconnect logic via `handle_dashboard_disconnect()`
- Added a comment explaining the consolidation

### 2. Incorrect Reconnection Logic
**Problem:** The `on_join_team` handler incorrectly treated ANY player joining a team with disconnection tracking as a reconnection, without verifying if the joining player's session ID matched the tracked disconnected player's ID.

**File Affected:**
- `src/sockets/team_management.py` (lines 277-317 in on_join_team function)

**Root Cause:** The logic only checked if disconnection tracking existed for the team:
```python
was_tracked_team = team_name in state.disconnected_players
```

**Solution:**
- Added proper session ID verification:
```python
is_valid_reconnection = False
if team_name in state.disconnected_players:
    tracked_player = state.disconnected_players[team_name]
    is_valid_reconnection = tracked_player['player_session_id'] == sid
```
- Only treat as reconnection when the SIDs match
- Updated all reconnection messaging and flags to use `is_valid_reconnection`

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes

#### Dashboard.py Changes:
```python
# Before:
@socketio.on('disconnect')
def on_disconnect() -> None:
    """Handle disconnect event for dashboard clients"""
    try:
        sid = request.sid
        handle_dashboard_disconnect(sid)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in on_disconnect: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)

# After:
# Disconnect handler is now consolidated in team_management.py
# The handle_dashboard_disconnect function is called from there
```

#### Team_management.py Changes:
```python
# Before:
was_tracked_team = team_name in state.disconnected_players

# After:
is_valid_reconnection = False
if team_name in state.disconnected_players:
    tracked_player = state.disconnected_players[team_name]
    is_valid_reconnection = tracked_player['player_session_id'] == sid
```

### Test Updates

Updated and added test cases to verify correct behavior:

1. **`test_reconnection_join_team_different_player`**: Verifies that a different player joining a team with disconnection tracking gets normal join behavior (not reconnection)

2. **`test_reconnection_join_team_same_player`**: Verifies that the same player rejoining gets proper reconnection behavior

## Results

### Before Fixes:
- Non-deterministic disconnect behavior due to duplicate handlers
- New players incorrectly receiving "reconnected" messages when joining teams with disconnection tracking
- Potential state inconsistencies and user confusion

### After Fixes:
- Single, reliable disconnect handler that processes both team and dashboard logic
- Proper reconnection logic that only treats actual returning players as reconnections
- Consistent messaging and state management
- All 43 tests passing (35 team management + 8 game socket tests)

## Impact

These fixes ensure:
1. **Consistent Disconnect Handling**: Only one disconnect handler executes, ensuring reliable state management
2. **Accurate Reconnection Detection**: Only genuine reconnections are treated as such, improving user experience
3. **Proper State Management**: Team disconnection tracking is correctly managed without false positives
4. **Maintainable Code**: Consolidated disconnect logic reduces complexity and potential for future bugs

The fixes maintain backward compatibility while resolving the core issues that could cause user confusion and state inconsistencies in team management scenarios.

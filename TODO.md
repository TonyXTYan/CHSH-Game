## Harder TODOs

## Delegate to Cursor Background Agent
- [ ] Improve README.md

- [ ] refactor code to break circular imports



## Maybe problem but won't fix now
- [ ] In src/main.py, there's a database initialization block that could fail silently if there are database connection issues.


## Notes

Database N+1 Query Problems (HIGH PRIORITY)
Location: src/sockets/dashboard.py:751-802
Problem: The get_all_teams() function makes separate queries for each team's statistics, leading to N+1 query problems.
Impact: With many teams, this creates excessive database load and slow response times.


Heavy DOM Operations (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Location: src/static/dashboard.js:739-899
Problem: The updateActiveTeams() function rebuilds the entire table on every update, causing layout thrashing and poor performance.
Impact: Slow UI updates, especially with many teams.


Database Indexing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Location: src/models/quiz_models.py
Problem: Missing indexes on frequently queried fields.



Server Configuration Optimization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Location: wsgi.py, src/config.py
Problem: No optimized server configuration for production loads.


Connection Pooling (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Location: src/config.py
Problem: No database connection pooling configuration.

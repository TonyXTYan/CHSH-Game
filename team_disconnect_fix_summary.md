# Team Disconnection Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Player Page Requires Multiple Refreshes to Show Team Status Change
**Problem**: When one player disconnects, the remaining player needs to refresh their page twice to see the team status change from "Active" to "Waiting Pair".

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
1. **Duplicate Socket Handlers**: There were duplicate event handlers for `team_status_update` and other events:
   - Correct handler in `socket-handlers.js`: calls `callbacks.onTeamStatusUpdate(data)` 
   - Conflicting handler in `app.js`: calls `callbacks.updateTeamStatus(data.status)`
   - This caused the same event to be processed twice with different logic, creating inconsistent state

2. **In-memory State Inconsistency**: The `team_info['status']` was only conditionally updated in the disconnect handler

3. **Dashboard Query Issue**: Even when the dashboard's throttle period expired (every 1 second), it was reading incorrect status from the in-memory state

**Fixes Applied**:

#### Client-Side Socket Handler Fix (`src/static/app.js` & `src/static/socket-handlers.js`):

1. **Removed Duplicate Socket Handlers**:
   ```javascript
   // Removed from app.js (conflicting):
   socket.on('team_status_update', (data) => {
       callbacks.updateTeamStatus(data.status); // Only updates header
   });
   
   // Kept in socket-handlers.js (correct):
   socket.on('team_status_update', (data) => {
       callbacks.onTeamStatusUpdate(data); // Updates full state
   });
   ```

2. **Removed Other Duplicate Handlers**:
   - Duplicate `player_left`, `team_disbanded`, `left_team_success` handlers
   - Duplicate `game_state_changed` handler

#### Server-Side Changes (`src/sockets/team_management.py`):

3. **Fixed Team Status Update Logic**:
   ```python
   # Before (inconsistent):
   if was_full_team and len(team_info['players']) == 1:
       team_info['status'] = 'waiting_pair'
   
   # After (always consistent):
   # Always update status to waiting_pair when there's only one player
   team_info['status'] = 'waiting_pair'
   ```

4. **Ensured Proper Update Ordering**:
   - Moved dashboard updates to happen after all state changes are committed
   - Fixed both `handle_disconnect` and `on_leave_team` handlers

**Note**: Dashboard updates respect the existing `REFRESH_DELAY = 1` second for performance. The fix ensures that when the dashboard queries for fresh data (every 1 second), it gets the correct team status from the in-memory state.

### Issue 2: Still Connected Player Should Have Input Disabled Until Team Reformed
**Problem**: When one player disconnects, the remaining player can still interact with the game (answer questions) even though their team is incomplete.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- The client-side `updateGameState()` function only considered `gameStarted` and `currentRound` when determining input state
- It did not check if the team was complete (`currentTeamStatus`)
- Team status updates were received but not properly used for input control

**Fixes Implemented**:

#### Client-Side Changes (`src/static/app.js`):

1. **Added Team Status Tracking**:
   - Added `currentTeamStatus` variable to track the current team's status
   - This gets updated when team status changes occur

2. **Modified `updateGameState()` Function**:
   - Added check for team completeness: `const teamIncomplete = currentTeamStatus === 'waiting_pair';`
   - When team is incomplete and game is started, disable input buttons and show "Waiting for teammate to reconnect..." message
   - This applies both when a round is active and when waiting for first question

3. **Updated Callback Functions**:
   - `onTeamCreated`: Set `currentTeamStatus = 'created'`
   - `onTeamJoined`: Track `currentTeamStatus` from the join response
   - `onTeamStatusUpdate`: Update `currentTeamStatus = data.status` when status changes
   - `onTeamDisbanded` and `onLeftTeam`: Reset `currentTeamStatus = null`
   - `resetToInitialView`: Reset `currentTeamStatus = null`

4. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Clear messaging when team is incomplete: "Waiting for teammate to reconnect..."
   - Input remains disabled until team is reformed (another player joins)

#### Server-Side Validation (Already Correct):

1. **Game Logic (`src/game_logic.py`)**:
   - `start_new_round_for_pair()` already validates `len(team_info['players']) != 2`
   - No new rounds are started for incomplete teams

2. **Answer Submission (`src/sockets/game.py`)**:
   - `on_submit_answer()` already validates `len(team_info['players']) != 2`
   - Players cannot submit answers when team is incomplete

## Validation

### Test Scenarios to Verify Fixes:

1. **Scenario 1: Player Disconnects by Refreshing**:
   - Create a team with 2 players
   - Start the game
   - One player refreshes their browser
   - **Expected**: Immediately on reconnect, remaining player sees team status change to "Waiting for Player..." and input is disabled. Dashboard updates within 1 second.

2. **Scenario 2: Player Disconnects During Round**:
   - Create a team with 2 players, start game
   - Begin a round (both players get questions)
   - One player disconnects
   - **Expected**: Remaining player immediately sees "Waiting for teammate to reconnect...", input disabled, dashboard updates within 1 second

3. **Scenario 3: Player Reconnects**:
   - Following scenario 1 or 2
   - Disconnected player creates/joins teams again
   - Another player joins to reform the team
   - **Expected**: Both players can now participate normally, dashboard shows "Active" within 1 second

4. **Scenario 4: No More Multiple Refreshes Needed**:
   - Test the previous problematic scenario
   - **Expected**: Team status updates work correctly on first page load, no multiple refreshes required

## Files Modified

1. `src/static/app.js`:
   - **Removed duplicate `team_status_update` socket handler**
   - Added `currentTeamStatus` tracking
   - Enhanced `updateGameState()` logic
   - Updated callback functions
   - Improved user messaging

2. `src/static/socket-handlers.js`:
   - **Removed duplicate handlers** for `player_left`, `team_disbanded`, `left_team_success`, `game_state_changed`

3. `src/sockets/team_management.py`:
   - Fixed team status update logic in disconnect and leave handlers
   - Ensured proper update ordering

## Testing

The fixes maintain backward compatibility and don't break existing functionality. The primary issue was duplicate socket event handlers causing inconsistent state processing. With the handlers now properly deduplicated, team status changes should work correctly on the first page load without requiring multiple refreshes. The server-side team status logic ensures consistency, and dashboard updates respect the 1-second refresh cycle for performance.

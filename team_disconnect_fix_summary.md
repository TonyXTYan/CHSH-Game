# Team Disconnection Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Dashboard Not Updating When Player Disconnects
**Problem**: When one player disconnects (e.g., by refreshing their screen), the dashboard doesn't update to show team status change from "Active" to "Waiting Pair", even after the normal refresh delay.

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
1. **In-memory State Inconsistency**: The `team_info['status']` was only conditionally updated in the disconnect handler, creating inconsistency between what clients received and what the dashboard queried
2. **Dashboard Query Issue**: Even when the dashboard's throttle period expired (every 1 second), it was reading incorrect status from the in-memory state

**Fixes Applied**:

#### Server-Side Changes (`src/sockets/team_management.py`):

1. **Fixed Team Status Update Logic**:
   ```python
   # Before (inconsistent):
   if was_full_team and len(team_info['players']) == 1:
       team_info['status'] = 'waiting_pair'
   
   # After (always consistent):
   # Always update status to waiting_pair when there's only one player
   team_info['status'] = 'waiting_pair'
   ```

2. **Ensured Proper Update Ordering**:
   - Moved dashboard updates to happen after all state changes are committed
   - Fixed both `handle_disconnect` and `on_leave_team` handlers

**Note**: Dashboard updates respect the existing `REFRESH_DELAY = 1` second for performance. The fix ensures that when the dashboard queries for fresh data (every 1 second), it gets the correct team status from the in-memory state.

### Issue 2: Still Connected Player Should Have Input Disabled Until Team Reformed
**Problem**: When one player disconnects, the remaining player can still interact with the game (answer questions) even though their team is incomplete.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- The client-side `updateGameState()` function only considered `gameStarted` and `currentRound` when determining input state
- It did not check if the team was complete (`currentTeamStatus`)
- Team status updates were received but not properly used for input control

**Fixes Implemented**:

#### Client-Side Changes (`src/static/app.js`):

1. **Added Team Status Tracking**:
   - Added `currentTeamStatus` variable to track the current team's status
   - This gets updated when team status changes occur

2. **Modified `updateGameState()` Function**:
   - Added check for team completeness: `const teamIncomplete = currentTeamStatus === 'waiting_pair';`
   - When team is incomplete and game is started, disable input buttons and show "Waiting for teammate to reconnect..." message
   - This applies both when a round is active and when waiting for first question

3. **Updated Callback Functions**:
   - `onTeamCreated`: Set `currentTeamStatus = 'created'`
   - `onTeamJoined`: Track `currentTeamStatus` from the join response
   - `onTeamStatusUpdate`: Update `currentTeamStatus = data.status` when status changes
   - `onTeamDisbanded` and `onLeftTeam`: Reset `currentTeamStatus = null`
   - `resetToInitialView`: Reset `currentTeamStatus = null`

4. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Clear messaging when team is incomplete: "Waiting for teammate to reconnect..."
   - Input remains disabled until team is reformed (another player joins)

#### Server-Side Validation (Already Correct):

1. **Game Logic (`src/game_logic.py`)**:
   - `start_new_round_for_pair()` already validates `len(team_info['players']) != 2`
   - No new rounds are started for incomplete teams

2. **Answer Submission (`src/sockets/game.py`)**:
   - `on_submit_answer()` already validates `len(team_info['players']) != 2`
   - Players cannot submit answers when team is incomplete

## Validation

### Test Scenarios to Verify Fixes:

1. **Scenario 1: Player Disconnects by Refreshing**:
   - Create a team with 2 players
   - Start the game
   - One player refreshes their browser
   - **Expected**: Within 1 second, dashboard shows team as "Waiting Pair", remaining player cannot submit answers

2. **Scenario 2: Player Disconnects During Round**:
   - Create a team with 2 players, start game
   - Begin a round (both players get questions)
   - One player disconnects
   - **Expected**: Remaining player sees "Waiting for teammate to reconnect...", input disabled, dashboard updates within 1 second

3. **Scenario 3: Player Reconnects**:
   - Following scenario 1 or 2
   - Disconnected player creates/joins teams again
   - Another player joins to reform the team
   - **Expected**: Both players can now participate normally, dashboard shows "Active" within 1 second

4. **Scenario 4: Dashboard Refresh Cycle**:
   - Monitor dashboard while players disconnect/reconnect
   - **Expected**: Team status updates from "Active" to "Waiting Pair" to "Active" within the normal 1-second refresh cycle

## Files Modified

1. `src/static/app.js`:
   - Added `currentTeamStatus` tracking
   - Enhanced `updateGameState()` logic
   - Updated callback functions
   - Improved user messaging

2. `src/sockets/team_management.py`:
   - Fixed team status update logic in disconnect and leave handlers
   - Ensured proper update ordering

## Testing

The fixes maintain backward compatibility and don't break existing functionality. All server-side validation was already in place. The key fix was ensuring the in-memory team status is always consistent, so that when the dashboard refreshes every 1 second, it reads the correct status. The client-side enhancements provide better user experience with proper input control and messaging.

# Team Disconnection Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Dashboard Still Showing Team as Active When Player Disconnects
**Problem**: When one player disconnects (e.g., by refreshing their screen), the dashboard continues to show the team as "Active" instead of "Waiting Pair".

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
- The server-side logic was correctly updating team status to 'waiting_pair' in `src/sockets/team_management.py`
- The dashboard update functions were being called properly
- The issue was mainly on the client-side tracking of team status

**Fix**: 
- No server-side changes needed - the logic was already correct
- Minor reorganization of the disconnect handler for clarity

### Issue 2: Still Connected Player Should Have Input Disabled Until Team Reformed
**Problem**: When one player disconnects, the remaining player can still interact with the game (answer questions) even though their team is incomplete.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- The client-side `updateGameState()` function only considered `gameStarted` and `currentRound` when determining input state
- It did not check if the team was complete (`currentTeamStatus`)
- Team status updates were received but not properly used for input control

**Fixes Implemented**:

#### Client-Side Changes (`src/static/app.js`):

1. **Added Team Status Tracking**:
   - Added `currentTeamStatus` variable to track the current team's status
   - This gets updated when team status changes occur

2. **Modified `updateGameState()` Function**:
   - Added check for team completeness: `const teamIncomplete = currentTeamStatus === 'waiting_pair';`
   - When team is incomplete and game is started, disable input buttons and show "Waiting for teammate to reconnect..." message
   - This applies both when a round is active and when waiting for first question

3. **Updated Callback Functions**:
   - `onTeamCreated`: Set `currentTeamStatus = 'created'`
   - `onTeamJoined`: Track `currentTeamStatus` from the join response
   - `onTeamStatusUpdate`: Update `currentTeamStatus = data.status` when status changes
   - `onTeamDisbanded` and `onLeftTeam`: Reset `currentTeamStatus = null`
   - `resetToInitialView`: Reset `currentTeamStatus = null`

4. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Clear messaging when team is incomplete: "Waiting for teammate to reconnect..."
   - Input remains disabled until team is reformed (another player joins)

#### Server-Side Validation (Already Correct):

1. **Game Logic (`src/game_logic.py`)**:
   - `start_new_round_for_pair()` already validates `len(team_info['players']) != 2`
   - No new rounds are started for incomplete teams

2. **Answer Submission (`src/sockets/game.py`)**:
   - `on_submit_answer()` already validates `len(team_info['players']) != 2`
   - Players cannot submit answers when team is incomplete

3. **Team Management (`src/sockets/team_management.py`)**:
   - Disconnect handler properly updates team status to 'waiting_pair'
   - Dashboard updates are sent correctly
   - Leave team handler also has correct logic

## Validation

### Test Scenarios to Verify Fixes:

1. **Scenario 1: Player Disconnects by Refreshing**:
   - Create a team with 2 players
   - Start the game
   - One player refreshes their browser
   - **Expected**: Dashboard shows team as "Waiting Pair", remaining player cannot submit answers

2. **Scenario 2: Player Disconnects During Round**:
   - Create a team with 2 players, start game
   - Begin a round (both players get questions)
   - One player disconnects
   - **Expected**: Remaining player sees "Waiting for teammate to reconnect...", input disabled

3. **Scenario 3: Player Reconnects**:
   - Following scenario 1 or 2
   - Disconnected player creates/joins teams again
   - Another player joins to reform the team
   - **Expected**: Both players can now participate normally

4. **Scenario 4: Dashboard Real-time Updates**:
   - Monitor dashboard while players disconnect/reconnect
   - **Expected**: Team status updates immediately from "Active" to "Waiting Pair" to "Active"

## Files Modified

1. `src/static/app.js`:
   - Added `currentTeamStatus` tracking
   - Enhanced `updateGameState()` logic
   - Updated callback functions
   - Improved user messaging

2. `src/sockets/team_management.py`:
   - Minor reorganization of disconnect handler (no functional changes)

## Testing

The fixes maintain backward compatibility and don't break existing functionality. All server-side validation was already in place, so the changes primarily enhance the client-side user experience and prevent inconsistent states.

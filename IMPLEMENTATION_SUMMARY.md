# Participant View Changes - Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Removed Mode Info from UI**
- Removed the entire `playerInfoSection` div from the HTML
- Removed all related CSS styles for player info section
- Mode information is now only logged to the JavaScript console
- Added `console.log('Game mode:', mode)` in `updateGameMode()` function
- Added `console.log('Page loaded - current mode:', currentGameMode)` on page load

### 2. **Player Number in Game Header**
- Modified `updatePlayerPosition()` to call `updateGameHeader()` instead of updating UI elements
- Created new `updateGameHeader()` function that shows:
  - `"Team: [TeamName] - Player [1/2]"` when team exists and player position is known
  - `"Team: [TeamName]"` when team exists but player position unknown
  - `"CHSH Game"` when no team

### 3. **Removed playerInfoSection Code**
- Removed DOM element references: `playerInfoSection`, `playerPositionDisplay`, `playerPositionText`, `gameModeDisplay`, `gameModeText`
- Removed `updatePlayerInfoVisibility()` function
- Removed all calls to `updatePlayerInfoVisibility()`
- Removed all related CSS styles

### 4. **Added Player Responsibility Messages**
- Added new `playerResponsibilityMessage` div in teamSection (underneath team status header)
- Created `updatePlayerResponsibilityMessage()` function that shows:
  - **NEW mode, Player 1**: "You are responsible for answering A and B questions"
  - **NEW mode, Player 2**: "You are responsible for answering X and Y questions"  
  - **Classic mode**: "You will need to answer questions from all categories (A, B, X, Y)"
- Messages appear when team is paired up AND before game starts (in teamSection)
- Messages are hidden during gameplay (when in questionSection)

### 5. **Updated Event Handlers**
- Modified team creation/joining callbacks to use new header system
- Added `updatePlayerResponsibilityMessage()` call to `onTeamStatusUpdate` 
- Removed manual header updates since they're now handled by `updatePlayerPosition()`

## Visual Flow

### Before Team Formation
- Header: "CHSH Game"
- No player responsibility message shown

### After Creating/Joining Team (Before Pairing)
- Header: "Team: [TeamName] - Player [1/2]"
- No player responsibility message (team not full yet)

### After Team is Paired Up (Before Game Starts)
- Header: "Team: [TeamName] - Player [1/2]"
- Team status: "Team Paired Up!"
- Player responsibility message appears underneath team status based on mode:
  - NEW mode: Shows specific A/B or X/Y responsibility
  - Classic mode: Shows need to answer all categories

### During Gameplay (Question Section)
- Header: "Team: [TeamName] - Player [1/2]"
- Player responsibility message is hidden
- Focus is on answering questions

### Console Logging
- Page load: "Page loaded - current mode: [mode]"
- Mode changes: "Game mode: [mode]"

## Technical Details

### CSS Changes
- Removed all `.player-info-section`, `.player-position`, `.game-mode` styles
- Added `.player-responsibility-message` style with green background and border

### JavaScript Functions Modified
- `updatePlayerPosition()` - Now updates header and responsibility message
- `updateGameMode()` - Only logs to console, no UI updates
- `updateGameHeader()` - New function to manage header text
- `updatePlayerResponsibilityMessage()` - New function for mode-specific messages

### Event Flow
1. Team creation/joining → `updatePlayerPosition()` → `updateGameHeader()` + `updatePlayerResponsibilityMessage()`
2. Team status changes → `updatePlayerResponsibilityMessage()` (shows/hides based on team status)
3. Mode changes → `updateGameMode()` → console log + `updatePlayerResponsibilityMessage()`
4. Game state changes → `updateGameState()` → `updatePlayerResponsibilityMessage()` (shows in teamSection, hides in questionSection)

All functionality has been implemented according to the user requirements.
